# Tarski's world

![world](images/world.png)

Attempting to recreate Barwise and Etchemendy's
[Tarski's world](https://www.gradegrinder.net/Products/tw-index.html) in
[Doodle's Reactor](https://github.com/creativescala/doodle) using
[Scala 3](https://www.scala-lang.org).

They use 3D objects (like cube, tetrahedron, dodecahedron etc.) but I'm going with 2D as in
[Susanna Epp's Discrete Math book](https://github.com/spamegg1/Epp-Discrete-Math-5th-solutions/).
The image above is taken from there.

## Info

This is a [Scala-cli](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/) project.
With Scala 3.5.0 and above, you can simply run `scala compile .` and `scala test .`.

## Work in progress

Stay tuned!
